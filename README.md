# Colour-Science

Hi! I'm CÃ©dric DOLLET, I'm a french student. 
This is my github for the Gsoc 2021.

I upload all the original matlab function (from http://www.gujinwei.org/research/camspec/db.html by clicking on Code for recovering camera spectral sensitivity from a single image) and the translation in python that I have done.

getCameraSpectralSensitivityAltern.py is an alternative function, it makes the data easier to use.

all the function aren't completely translate yet the PCA related one work as well as getDaylightScalars
