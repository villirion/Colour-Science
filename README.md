# Colour-Science

Hi! I'm CÃ©dric DOLLET, I'm a french student. 
This is my github for the Gsoc 2021.

PCACameraSensitivity.m, getCameraSpectralSensitivity.m and GetEigenvector.m are the original matlab function that i have translate in python in PCA_python.py.

getCameraSpectralSensitivity.py is an alternative function to the one in PCA_python.py, it makes the data easier to use.
