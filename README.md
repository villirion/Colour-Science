# Colour-Science

Hi! I'm CÃ©dric DOLLET, I'm a french student. 
This is my github for the Gsoc 2021.

I upload all the original matlab function in matlab directory(from http://www.gujinwei.org/research/camspec/db.html by clicking on Code for recovering camera spectral sensitivity from a single image) and the translation in python that I have done in pyTrad. (The function ... isn't completely translate)

After translating most of the functions, we decided to keep only three functions that you can find directly in FinalFunct.
