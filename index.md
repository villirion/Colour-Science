## GSoC 2021 with NumFOCUS 

Hi ! I'm CÃ©dric DOLLET, a french student in Cergy a city near Paris. 
I've been selected to GSoC 2021 and this is a blog that will tell you my journey.

## Colour

Colour is an open-source python package providing a comprehensive number of
algorithms and datasets for colour-science. So it's a very complete package of
different ways to manage colors in scientific and research projects.

# My proposal

You can found the propasal I send [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mO5zLtGICHV1qgvm7F7Hz8ZniUTRhU7E/view?ths=true)
To summarise I will focus on the implementation of a support for spectral sensitivity 
functions for digital color Cameras and the implementation of new colour.appearance model.
