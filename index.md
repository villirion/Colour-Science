## GSoC 2021 with NumFOCUS 

Hello, I am CÃ©dric DOLLET, a French student in Cergy, near Paris. 
I have been selected for GSoC 2021 and here is a blog that will tell you about my journey.

## Colour

Colour is an open-source python package providing a complete set of algorithms and datasets for color science. So it is a very complete package of different ways to handle colors in scientific and research projects.

# My proposal

You can find the propasal I sent [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mO5zLtGICHV1qgvm7F7Hz8ZniUTRhU7E/view?ths=true)
In summary, I will focus on implementing support for spectral sensitivity functions for digital color cameras and implementing a new color and appearance model.
